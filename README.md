# glob-krig
Nonstationary kriging routines for global spatial data

## Purpose
With the python-code provided here, you can **interpolate** irregular data distributed in **spherical (i.e. geographical) coordinates** 
using **non-stationary kriging** interpolation. 

This technique will mainly be interesting to you, if you work with **global data** and are interested in 
**interpolation uncertainties**. 

## Getting started
We provide two publicly available data sets, one for Canada and one for South America with Moho depths.
There are two examples (as jupyter notebooks) that show how these data can be used for interpolation.
For a quick look, see example.html where the code is shown together with the output and resulting figures.
